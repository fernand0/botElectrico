Key Differences Between main and gh-pages Branches - botElectrico.py:

MAIN BRANCH:
- Uses argparse for command-line arguments (-s for simulation, -t for time)
- Imports many libraries including pandas, plotly for advanced visualization
- Has modular structure with functions split across multiple files (data_handler.py, price_calculator.py, visualizer.py, social_media.py)
- Uses API constants (API_BASE, API_URL, TIME_RANGES, etc.) defined in the file
- Has comprehensive error handling for missing socialModules dependency
- Implements both daily summary and hourly message posting functions
- Uses structured data processing with safe_get function
- Includes multiple visualization options (Chart.js, Plotly, Matplotlib)

GH-PAGES BRANCH:
- Simpler import structure with fewer dependencies
- Uses direct imports from socialModules.configMod
- More basic command-line handling (just checks for -t flag)
- Hardcoded API URL construction
- Different time range definitions
- Simpler data retrieval and processing
- Basic matplotlib plotting only
- Different social media destination handling
- Different message formatting and length checking
- More basic error handling

SUMMARY:
The main branch represents a more mature, modular version with better error handling and multiple visualization options, while the gh-pages branch appears to be an older, simpler version that may be used for static site generation or a different deployment scenario.
